# PDLP CPU Engine v1

A self-contained C++17 primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) engine for continuous
linear programs in the form

```text
minimize    c^T x + c0
subject to  row_lower <= A x <= row_upper
            var_lower <= x <= var_upper
```

No third-party dependencies: sparse storage, equilibration, the iteration
kernel, the threading runtime and the termination tests are all built here from
the mathematical foundations.

It deliberately does not include an MPS parser and does not depend on or modify
the repository's `model::Model`. Integration happens through a separate adapter
that converts `const model::Model&` into `pdlp::CompiledLp`.

## Components

| Component | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Sparse storage | `sparse_matrix.*` | Immutable CSR + CSC, O(nnz) construction, nnz-balanced execution plan |
| Threading | `parallel.*` | Persistent spin-then-yield worker pool |
| Equilibration | `scaling.*` | Ruiz row/column infinity-norm scaling |
| Preconditioner | `preconditioner.*` | Pock-Chambolle diagonal scaling, power-iteration spectral estimate |
| Iteration kernel | `pdhg_kernel.*` | Fused row-bound PDHG step, no slack variables |
| Step control | `step_controller.*` | Bounded step adaptation, restart-driven primal weight |
| Averaging | `iterate_average.*` | Weighted running mean of the iterate sequence |
| Restarts | `restart_controller.*` | Sufficient / necessary / artificial restart triggers |
| Termination | `termination.*` | Primal residual, dual residual, duality gap |
| Polishing | `feasibility_polishing.*` | Conservative KKT refinement |

## Build

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
./build/pdlp_example
./build/pdlp_bench 200000 400000 10 500 8    # rows cols nnz/row iters threads
```

`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` defaults to `Release` if unset, because an unoptimised build
of this engine is roughly twenty times slower and that is easy to mistake for
the solver being slow.

Without CMake:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -pthread -I include src/*.cpp tests/test_pdlp.cpp -o pdlp_tests
./pdlp_tests
```

## Step size policy

The step size is chosen by the PDLP adaptive linesearch, not pinned to the
Pock-Chambolle bound `eta <= 1/||A||`. That bound is worst case over all
directions; the iterate moves in one direction, where the effective curvature is
routinely far milder. After each trial step the linesearch measures the curvature
that step actually encountered,

```text
eta_bar = ||dz||^2_omega / (2 |dy^T A dx|),
||dz||^2_omega = omega * sum_j dx_j^2 / T_j + (1/omega) * sum_i dy_i^2 / Sigma_i
```

accepts if `eta <= eta_bar`, and updates
`eta <- min{(1 - (k+1)^-0.3) eta_bar, (1 + (k+1)^-0.6) eta}`.

Two details matter. The movement is measured in the inverse-preconditioner norm,
because that is the norm the PDHG descent condition is stated in; using the plain
Euclidean norm makes the bound wrong whenever a preconditioner is active. And
`dy^T A dx` costs nothing extra: the iteration carries `A*x^k`, computes `A*x'`,
and recovers both the extrapolated activity and `A*dx` by subtraction.

Measured on the 20-instance family, the linesearch runs steps about **1.9x above
the static bound** and rejects almost nothing (1.01 trials per accepted
iteration).

## Performance

Apple M3 (4 performance + 4 efficiency cores), clang 15, `-O2`. Synthetic sparse
LPs, 10 nonzeros per row, time per PDHG iteration (lower is better):

| Problem | Before | 1 thread | 8 threads | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 20k x 40k, 200k nnz | 1154 us | 455 us | 109 us | 10.6x |
| 60k x 120k, 600k nnz | 3678 us | 1685 us | 374 us | 9.8x |
| 200k x 400k, 2M nnz | 13348 us | 6303 us | 1694 us | 7.9x |

Where the single-thread gain comes from:

- residual and movement norms accumulate sums of squares instead of folding
  through `std::hypot`, which is a non-vectorisable libm call costing about
  20 ns per element and dominated the original iteration;
- the sparse products are fused into the proximal steps, so `A^T y` and `A x'`
  are consumed coordinate-wise and never materialised;
- the termination check caches its problem-invariant normalisers and allocates
  no temporaries, instead of allocating three vectors and rebuilding two norms
  on every check;
- the dual proximal step is branchless and division-free;
- `fromTriplets` uses counting sort, O(nnz) rather than a comparison sort over
  16-byte triplets.

Parallel work is claimed dynamically from nonzero-balanced chunks rather than
statically partitioned. On a hybrid CPU a static split makes every barrier wait
on an efficiency core; with dynamic claiming, 8 threads went from slower than 4
to the fastest configuration.

Sparse matrix-vector products are bitwise identical between the serial and
parallel paths. Reductions are not: partial sums combine in worker order, so
residuals can differ in the last bits with thread count.

## Convergence

Work to reach a 1e-8 KKT tolerance, geometric mean over the 20-instance family,
measured in matrix passes. Trials are the unit rather than iterations because a
rejected linesearch trial costs a full pass, so a policy cannot win by trading
iterations for trials.

| Configuration | Matrix passes | Solved |
|---|---|---|
| bounded ratchet (the original policy) | budget exhausted | 0/20 |
| fixed step at the Pock-Chambolle bound | 15756 | 9/20 |
| adaptive linesearch | 9007 | 11/20 |
| adaptive linesearch, restart floor 64 | **8631** | **12/20** |

The original bounded ratchet was not merely conservative, it was harmful: it
drove the step down to its floor, about 1% of the static bound, and never
converged on anything. Most of the improvement above comes from removing it;
the linesearch then buys a further 1.8x over a fair fixed-step baseline.

Against HiGHS on the same family, at a 300000-iteration budget: 18 of 20
instances reach `optimal`, worst relative objective difference 3.4e-6, and on the
harder instances the engine is faster in wall clock (instance_17: 0.82 s against
16.8 s; instance_13: 0.46 s against 2.79 s). This is the regime the engine is
built for. It is not the regime of a few hundred rows solved to 1e-9, where
simplex terminates finitely at a vertex and a first-order method cannot compete
on principle.

## Measured negatives

Two accelerations were implemented, benchmarked and then **removed**. The numbers
are kept here so nobody spends the effort again without new evidence; the code is
gone because carrying two permanently disabled schemes is dead weight.

**Halpern acceleration.** `z^{k+1} = lambda_k T(z^k) + (1-lambda_k) z^anchor`
with `lambda_k = (k+1)/(k+2)` counted from the last restart. Slower than the
plain step in every regime tried: 10800 matrix passes against 9007 for the
baseline, and worse at every restart frequency from none at all through a
5000-iteration floor, with and without averaging, and on a fixed step as well as
the linesearch. Published gains for restarted Halpern PDHG are measured against
*averaged* PDHG under a restart rule built on the fixed-point residual; this
engine restarts on the KKT score and restarts often, which is the likeliest
explanation. Worth revisiting only if the restart criterion changes.

**Safeguarded Anderson acceleration.** Type-II on the PDHG fixed-point map, with
a Cholesky solve of the regularised normal equations and a residual safeguard.

| Configuration | Matrix passes | Solved | Wall time |
|---|---|---|---|
| adaptive linesearch | **8631** | **12/20** | **4.7 s** |
| fixed step | 15212 | 10/20 | 5.4 s |
| fixed step + Anderson, depth 5 | 12089 | 9/20 | 39.1 s |
| linesearch + Anderson, depth 5 | 17926 | 10/20 | 41.2 s |

The mechanism does work where its assumptions hold: against a fixed step, where
the operator is genuinely constant, depth 5 cut matrix passes by 1.26x. It still
lost on every count that matters. It never approached the linesearch, and
combined with the linesearch it was worse than either alone, because an adaptive
step changes the operator every iteration and the history then mixes samples from
different operators. Wall time was eight times the baseline: the safeguard costs
an extra pass over the matrix per iteration, and the history dot products are
O(depth * (n + m)) on top of that.

**The bounded step ratchet** that predated the linesearch was not merely
conservative but actively harmful, driving the step down to about 1% of the
static bound and converging on nothing (0/20). It has been removed rather than
kept as a fallback option.

## Infeasibility and unboundedness

PDHG has no basis to read a Farkas certificate off, so the certificate comes from
where the iterates go rather than from where they stop. On an infeasible primal
the dual iterates diverge, and the direction they diverge along converges to a
Farkas ray; the same holds for the primal iterates and an improving ray on an
unbounded problem. Following Applegate et al. (2021), the difference of iterates
is tested rather than the iterates themselves, since it converges to the ray
faster.

A direction is accepted only when its distance to the cone the certificate
requires, measured relative to the certificate's own value, falls below
`infeasibilityTolerance`. Both tests run on the original problem, for the same
reason termination does: a certificate for a rescaled problem is not a
certificate for the one the caller handed in.

Verdicts agree with HiGHS on every infeasible and unbounded instance in the
validation family, and detection is far cheaper than a factorization-based
solver's:

| Instance | HiGHS | this engine |
|---|---|---|
| infeasible, 788 x 1104 | 0.003 s | 0.001 s |
| infeasible, 1230 x 1710 | 0.004 s | 0.001 s |
| unbounded, 825 x 1155 | 1.286 s | 0.007 s |
| unbounded, 1267 x 1761 | 4.830 s | 0.014 s |

`testFeasibleProblemsAreNotFlagged` guards the property that matters most: a
feasible bounded problem must never be reported infeasible or unbounded.

**For a branch-and-bound caller:** pruning a node needs only the status, not the
ray. The rays are what Benders feasibility cuts and user-facing proofs need.

## Known limitations

These are real and should be read before quoting this engine against a
commercial solver.

1. **No infeasibility or unboundedness certificate.** An unbounded or infeasible
   LP runs to the iteration limit. The engine never reports `Optimal` in those
   cases (`testUnboundedIsNotReportedOptimal` guards this), but it cannot tell
   the caller *why* it failed to converge. Farkas-ray detection from the
   difference of successive iterates is the next correctness item, and is now the
   highest-value remaining work.

2. **Restarts trigger on the KKT score, not the normalised duality gap.** The
   linear-convergence theory for restarted PDHG is stated for the localised
   normalised duality gap `mu_r(z)`, which has a sharpness property near the
   solution set that the raw residual lacks. Computing `mu_r` exactly is a
   trust-region subproblem: it separates coordinate-wise given a Lagrange
   multiplier, so it costs a bisection with an O(n+m) evaluation per step. That
   is affordable at the current check frequency and is the main algorithmic item
   still outstanding.

3. **No presolve.** Reversible presolve and postsolve are outside this engine and
   owned elsewhere.

4. **Feasibility polishing is a placeholder.** `FeasibilityPolisher` performs
   conservative small-step KKT refinement, not the paper's feasibility polishing.
   It is replaceable without changing the solver interface.

5. **Not benchmarked on Netlib, MIPLIB or Mittelmann.** Validation uses synthetic
   families and HiGHS as a reference. The standard sets need an MPS reader in the
   adapter layer, which is deliberately outside this module.

6. **No GPU path.** The kernel is deliberately shaped for one: the two fused
   halves are coordinate-parallel with a single barrier between them, which maps
   onto two CUDA kernels, and the linesearch's reductions are the only device
   synchronisation points per iteration. Nothing here targets a GPU yet.

## Integration boundary

The model adapter must:

1. convert maximisation to minimisation;
2. copy the objective and objective offset;
3. copy variable and row bounds;
4. convert `Constraint.linearTerms` into matrix triplets;
5. build `SparseMatrix::fromTriplets()`;
6. preserve original row/column index mappings for later postsolve.

Do not add MPS parsing logic to this module.
